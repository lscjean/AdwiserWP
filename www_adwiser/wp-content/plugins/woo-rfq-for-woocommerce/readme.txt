== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* Version 1.7.9998 and higher is compatible with WooCommerce 3.x or higher


= Documention =

= General Options =

NP Quote Request WooCommerce enables you to operate in your choice of 2 different modes: Normal Checkout mode or RFQ mode.

= Normal Checkout Mode =
Normal Checkout mode shows prices by default except on products that are RFQ enabled in the product setup page(Advanced Tab) in admin.  You can choose specific products in the product setup that you want customers to request a quote. The prices for these products will be hidden by default unless you choose the option "Show Prices With Normal Checkout"; then all prices will show regardless of RFQ status.  So you could select some products to be available for the customer to purchase through the regular checkout proceedure, OR allow the customer to request a quote on that product. All quote requests are added to the RFQ cart and when submitted, and saved as an order with an RFQ status. All other product purchases can check out normally.

The Normal Checkout mode gives you the most flexibility in offering your products for sale. For example, a customer loves the sweatshirts you sell and decides to buy one at your special sale price of $32 (regularly $38). But then, the customer realizes these are just what his team (25 people) has been looking for--along with the matching sweatpants. Using the Normal Checkout mode, this customer can purchase his sale sweatshirt, and also request a quote for pricing for the 25 sweatshirts and 25 sweatpants for his team.


= Product setup =
Applicable to Normal Checkout only. In the product setup advanced tab you can enable requesting quotes for the product by checking "Enable RFQ for this product".

= RFQ Checkout Mode =
RFQ Checkout mode allows the customer to only be able to check out using a request for quote. This mode hides all prices for the customer by default, however you have the option to allow prices to be shown. The items in the cart are saved after the checkout as an order with RFQ status. You can then adjust the prices and turn the order to a pending status to allow payment by the customer.


= Email setup =
When a customer requests a quote, an order is created with "quote_request" status and emails are sent out to the customer and the store manager.
Emails are added to the WooCommerce email settings section and can be enabled/disabled. Email templates can be overridden as you would with other emails by copying the "woocommerce/emails" to your theme.


= Work Flow =

**In Normal Checkout mode**

* Customer shops and can check out normally to purchase items at set price (for items with a visible price).
* Customer can request quotes for products that have been RFQ enabled in product setup (whether or not price is visible).
* Customer adds items for quote request to the RFQ List.
* Customer can submit their request in the quote request page (instead of paying, customer submits a request for quote).
* The request creates an order that can be viewed in the Order section.
* Shop manager recieves an email that a quote is requested.
* The request is viewed and the price adjusted as desired.
* Manager sends an invoice when price is agreed upon.
* Manager adjusts the status of the request to order-pending.
* Customer can pay the invoice online from the "my account" menu, after the status is set to pending payment.
* Customer can see the price and your normal payment gateways when paying for orders with pending payment status.

**In RFQ mode**

* ALL products are checked out through the RFQ process above, regardless of whether or not the price shows.
* At checkout, instead of paying, customer submits a request for quote.
* The request creates an order that can be viewed in the Order section.
* Shop manager recieves an email that a quote is requested.
* The request is viewed and the price adjusted as desired.
* Manager sends an invoice when price is agreed upon.
